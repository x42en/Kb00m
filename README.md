This is a peer2peer application based on JXTA v2.7 which allow chat, message and file transfert secured based on certificates.
This has been a personnal project to implement JXTA, but I haven't been able to finish it properly has JXTA is no longer supported...

I'm looking for people who would be interested to continue the project and has strong knowledge of how PKI are managed by Java (and JXTA) in order to develop the application based on proper PKI. Curently each client accept any certificate as valid...

Feel free to ask me about how it works, I would be glad to answer you and start again this awesome project... Anonymous peer2peer application still does not exists !!

> Note: Most of the work based on JXTA is done...
